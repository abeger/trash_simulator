# Trash Simulator

I want to see if there's an advantage to being first in the game "Trash".

## Rules of Trash

Deal 10 cards to each person.

Arrange the cards face-down into a tableau of two rows of five. They represent the numbers 1-5 and 6-10.

Each turn, a player draws a card. Depending on the card's rank, do the following:

* A Jack or Queen is Trash. Discard and your turn is over.
* Ace through 10 gets placed face-up into the appropriate spot in your tableau. If the card in that spot is already face-up, discard and your turn is over. If the card is face-down, pick it up and replace it with the drawn card. Now place this card as if you had drawn it.
* Kings are wild. Use it to fill in any face-down spot. If you later draw the card the king is filling in for, you may replace the king with the drawn card and place the king in a new face-down spot.

First person to have their entire tableau face-up wins.
